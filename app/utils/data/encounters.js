      'Centuries ago an expedition left earth to a planet 100 light years away. This planet was believed to be capable of sustaining life. This expedition was humanities farthest joruney yet, and unfortunately could only be one way; It was a colonization mission. Equiped with the latest in space faring and space station technology a group of 100 people left all they had known behind to start a new chapter for humanity.',
      'The theories of the planet turned out to be true, covered in lush green plants and similar in many ways to earth. A wide range of climates with an average of just right for all kinds of plant life to thrive. Months after arriving the first crew embarked from the new station to explore the planet. This was the first encounter of what came to be known as the terror.',
      'Your father was the only to return to the space station after that journey. What has now become common legend, giant slimy metalic insectoids have infested the planet, coexisting with the plants, but dominating all other forms of life. Upon the crews arrival they were quickly discovered and targeted. The creatures could sense them kilometers ahead; flying through the air at speeds up to two dozen meters per second, and are on average the size of a human teenager. They drop down from the sky and use their long pincers to slash from a distance. If your father wasn\'t in the ship and able to seal it off no one would have returned that day.',
      'With limited resources on the station a solution was needed to maintain life for the colony. There have been successful missions down to the planet, but many more unsucessul. Its a dangerous option, but the few successful missions have returned giving bountiful rewards and tales of abandoned structures from intelligent life.',
      'One crew was sent to investigate a nearby star system. From their first and only scouting it seems this could be another viable option for sustaining the colony, based on radio transmission; but none returned',
      'That was twenty years ago. The station has managed, but never flourished.',
      'You have just come of age, and graduated from your studies. Eager to live up to your fathers name, you arrive a few minutes early your first day of work...',

      'This is the second time our station has sent an expedition to the nearby star system. The first crew didn\'t return, but spoke of bountiful resources over radio.',
      'A lot of energy and resources are required for this journey; historically its been avoided and seen as a last option.',
      'The journey to the system will take 3 months and there is no rescue operation. This is our last ship capable of going that far from the station. You and your crew board nervously, unsure if you will return.',
      'Months pass on an uneventful journey through the void. The crew has become quite close but is on the edge of being contained in a ship too long. Any longer and I\'m not sure that familiarity would last.',
      'Upon arriving at the system the crew is in awe of the purple star and planets of red, blue, green and yellow. Scans indicate radiation levels are of similar type and amount as Earth\'s sun, you deem it safe and carry onward.',
      'Upon reaching the outer atmosphere of the blue planet your ships scanners go haywire and all alarms are going off at once. What\'s going on you collectively cry. Someone looks out the window and calls for everyone else to join',
      'You see 30 ships materialize out of nowhere and your scanners immediately calm down. Humanity hasn\'t mastered warp travel yet, the theories are in place but no one has been able to crack it. It dawns on the crew that humanity isn\'t the first spacefaring species.',
      'Somehow they understand our comms links and the indication for incoming video is flashing. No one says a word.',
      'You walk over to it, and are unable to bring yourself to accept it for what seems like eternity. You finally press it and immediately the video appears with a human and an unknown creature standing calmly.',
      'You can\'t make out any words to greet them.',
      'Hello adventurers from Earth External Station 4, I was wondering if you would ever come looking for me. I\'m sure you have many questions, I assure you, that you are safe, I am safe, and I will answer your questions in time.',
      'I\'m the last survivor of the crew who landed here twenty years ago. We landed on the yellow planet and were greeted with vast beauty and seemingly limitless new species of plant life. We didn\'t find any creatures and had a peaceful stay here. We spent weeks gathering resources, and preparing for the journey home.',
      'We sent our last radio broadcast detailing the success we had and then we departed. During ascension in the atmosphere a minor system in the ship started to malfunction. We carried on, but only when we were outside the pull of the planets gravity did the entire ship shut down. The malfunctioning system had fried everything else.',
      'As we floated through space, enjoying the last of our rations we hear a large thud on the bottom of the ship and experienced a return to gravity.',
      'The Akkari pryed open the door and greeted us. We didn\'t understand each other at first, and it took months to get a proper translation in place. However they were peaceful, kind, and generous to us. ',
      'We quickly learned of their species, where they came from, where they are now, and some of the great technologies invented.',
      'They told us they\'ve known about earth for millenia, however they are bound by moral obligation not to interfere. When they discovered our radio broadcast from one of their relay outposts they were intrigued. They sent out a welcoming party expecting to find intelligent life had settled on the planet. When they didn\'t find us on the planet, they didn\'t have to go far to find us adrift.',
      'We learned because of the life convention they were welcome to communicate with us as individuals, but not further as a species. They promised to host us while we wait for our species return in which would satisfy the convention for a proper first contact.',
      'Unfortunately the rest of my crew died of an unkown inllness, so they were limited to my knowledge of our species. Luckily it was enough to patch our comms systems and be ready to send you this.',
      'I\'m going to send you coordinates of a nearby station. Lets meet in person there.',
      'Your map flashes with said coordinates and the video link dies.',
      'Your ship goes haywire again as the 30 ships dissapear into the void.',
      'Your crew can\'t beleive it, the stories of the past had become legends. To actually witness and be apart of the continuation is surreal. You decide the best course of action is to go to the coordinates. The journey should take a week with our ship.',
      'Three days into the journey the sensors are picking up an incoming ship, its not the same signal as the Akkari.',
